# sf-installer

Source code for installer(s) for the [Streamflow Forecasting software stack](https://csiro-hydroinformatics.github.io/streamflow-forecasting-tools-onboard/)

## Technical notes

The Windows installer is build with [WiX 4](https://wixtoolset.org/). The initial steps to find out how to build this installer were captured in a few blog posts; see [Windows installer with WiX 4 - part 1](https://jmp75.github.io/work-blog/posts/20230315-windows-installer-wix) for an idiosyncratic tutorial on using WiX 4.
